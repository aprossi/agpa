## Geophysical probing, LIDAR/SLAM and drone mapping. 

The project aims at integrating training and data collection with geophysical in-situ and remote sensing methods with analogue field geology procedures

raining in basic geoscience as well as using specialised geophysical equipment allowed for an impressive scientific return for the relatively limited set of Apollo mission to the moon. Future exploration can count on much more advanced techniques and experiments, such as laser scanning: Basic geophysical data collection can be of great importance for contextualising geological information collected by human or robotic explorers as well as for capturing geological information hidden to regular geological reconnaissance, and provide long-term monitoring.

## AGPA Experiments

### AGPA-D - Drone-based remote sensing mapping

### AGPA-G - Geoelectrical probing of lava tubes from the surface

### AGPA-L - Laser scanning from inside lava tubes

### AGPA-S - Passive seismic monitoring
